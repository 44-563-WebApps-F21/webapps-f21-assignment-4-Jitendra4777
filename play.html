    LORD ILLINGWORTH.  The only difference between the saint and the sinner
    is that every saint has a past, and every sinner has a future.
    
    LADY HUNSTANTON.  Ah! that quite does for me.  I haven’t a word to say.
    You and I, dear Mrs. Arbuthnot, are behind the age.  We can’t follow Lord
    Illingworth.  Too much care was taken with our education, I am afraid.
    To have been well brought up is a great drawback nowadays.  It shuts one
    out from so much.
    
    MRS. ARBUTHNOT.  I should be sorry to follow Lord Illingworth in any of
    his opinions.
    
    LADY HUNSTANTON.  You are quite right, dear.
    
    [GERALD _shrugs his shoulders and looks irritably over at his mother_.
    _Enter_ LADY CAROLINE.]
    
    LADY CAROLINE.  Jane, have you seen John anywhere?
    
    LADY HUNSTANTON.  You needn’t be anxious about him, dear.  He is with
    Lady Stutfield; I saw them some time ago, in the Yellow Drawing-room.
    They seem quite happy together.  You are not going, Caroline?  Pray sit
    down.
    
    LADY CAROLINE.  I think I had better look after John.
    
    [_Exit_ LADY CAROLINE.]
    
    LADY HUNSTANTON.  It doesn’t do to pay men so much attention.  And
    Caroline has really nothing to be anxious about.  Lady Stutfield is very
    sympathetic.  She is just as sympathetic about one thing as she is about
    another.  A beautiful nature.
    
    [_Enter_ SIR JOHN _and_ MRS. ALLONBY.]
    
    Ah! here is Sir John!  And with Mrs. Allonby too!  I suppose it was Mrs.
    Allonby I saw him with.  Sir John, Caroline has been looking everywhere
    for you.
    
    MRS. ALLONBY.  We have been waiting for her in the Music-room, dear Lady
    Hunstanton.
